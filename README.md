## Guidelines

Initial guidelines of this assignment were to create a part of a structure of an online shop. The initial purpose was to practice the basics of OOP and then to write correct unit and integration tests for all the functionalities using the _jest_ library.

## Running tests

`npm install`
2. Afterwards run tests with the command:
`npm test`
